Find out why when trying to delete_history of a GLV community it fails

Infering C. Implement way to minimize the error between observed and predicted with C using Abby's paper method (EM)

I found a bug. wrong parameter being fed to hill_climber. It has to be data, instead of z_pred!!!
Fixing this now. 
I need to reverse the changes minimizing separatelly because maybe now it works
I am going to branch and see. 

#### Sep 30,2022

So, I have to reverse the **kwargs sacada, porque no lo ha sido tanto. Despues tengo que hardcode the different options; 123,213,312 for what parameter is varable

I am trying to debug the parallel tempering. Now it goes to 0 or 1 allways, because of how I fix outliers. I have to fix that

#### Oct 05,2022

Ideas for debugging my code

	-Plot the SSQ of each chain
	-Come up with a different way of mixing chains
	-Give a gradient when z are negative

#### Oct 06,2022

	Tempering algorithm working well now. However, it gets stuck at 210 of SSQ, and it should't. I need to come up with a way of perturbing the parameters that is smart, and gets me out of this local minima

#### Oct 07,2022

	I discovered what is causing the local minima stuckness. Its because I am inside the feasibility cone, and its too hard to get outside of it bc of the barrier I have put. I have to put no barrier so the parameter (even the unfeasible ones) are explored, and I arrive to a solution. In the end, I can set the barrier up when I am close, but I think this won't be necessary since the temperature is going down.

	I thought it was that, but it isn't. There was a bug in the ssq function. Fixed, but now I put the same species, and obtain different equilibria...

#### Oct 11,2022

	Ideas to make optimization scheme faster: 
	1. depending on what parameters are performing poorly, minimize them separatedly
	2. Use a gradient-descent algorithm to refine search when posible
	3. Make temperature linked to ssq, in order to maximize the descent velocity

#### Oct 11,2022

	Why do I not converge? Why does my algorthm increase instead of decrease?...
	I hate my life

#### Oct 12,2022

	Lets check if the elements of matrix B are uniformly distributed.
	--TODO: Debug code to perturb C, rho and D differently
